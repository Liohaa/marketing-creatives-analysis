# Marketing Creatives Analysis

This folder has a Jupyter Notebook (`creative_analysis.ipynb`) that shows a full analysis of marketing creatives using Python.  
The notebook includes data cleaning, metric calculations (ROI, ROAS, Conversion Rate, Cost Per Acquisition, etc.) and various visualizations (boxplots, violinplots, scatter plots, heatmaps, treemaps, and bubble charts) 
The main goal is to find which creative ideas give the return on investment, conversion rates, cost efficiency, sales performance, and customer satisfaction.
