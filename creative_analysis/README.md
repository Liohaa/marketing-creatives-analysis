# Marketing Creatives Analysis

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`creative_analysis.ipynb`) that shows a full analysis of marketing creatives using Python.

The notebook includes data cleaning, calculation of key metrics and visualizations with explanations. 
The main goal is to find which creative ideas give the return on investment, conversion rates, cost efficiency, sales performance, and customer satisfaction.

## Analysis Highlights

- Calculation of metrics such as ROI, ROAS, Conversion Rate (CVR), Cost per Acquisition (CPA), Cost per Click (CPC), Revenue per Unit Sold, and Customer Satisfaction scores.
- Visualizations including bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps, treemaps, and bubble charts to explore the relationships between creatives and performance metrics.
- Insights on which creative ideas lead to higher ROI, better conversions, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction.

## Machine Learning Predictions

The project also includes a machine learning section where a Random Forest Regressor is used to predict key marketing metrics:

- **Conversions**
- **Average Check** (Revenue per Conversion)
- **Clicks**

Key points of the Machine Learning approach:

- Features used: Budget, CPC, CVR, CPA
- Data split into training and test sets (80/20)
- Model evaluation with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared metrics
- Visual comparison of actual vs predicted values through scatter plots

This Machine Learning component helps assess how budget and cost-related features can predict conversions and revenue outcomes.
